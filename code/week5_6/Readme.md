# Week 5 & 6: Image Semantic Segmentation

- Task (a): Run the provided code. Use the preconfigured experiment file (camvid_segmentation.py) to segment objects with the FCN8 model
   * [x]  Analyze the dataset
   * [x] Evaluate on train, val and test sets
  
 - Task (b): Read two papers 
   * [ ] Fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation (Long et al. CVPR, 2015)
   * [ ] Another paper of free choice

 - Task (c): Train the network on a different dataset 
   * [x] Set-up a new experiment file to image semantic segmentation on another dataset (Cityscapes, KITTI,  Synthia, ...)
   * [x] Use the FCN8 model as before
   
 - Task (d): Implement a new network 
   * [ ] Select one network from the state of the art (SegnetVGG, DeepLab, ResnetFCN, ...)
   * [ ] Integrate the new model into the framework
   * [ ] Evaluate the new model on CamVid. Train from scratch and/or fine-tune
   
 - Task (e): Boost the performance of your network
 
 - Task (f): Write the report for Weeks 5/6
